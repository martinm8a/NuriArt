        "title1": "Context",
        "desc1": "The first Rats DAO Genesis token started minting on December 23, 2021. In the last two months we experienced tremendous growth and became a game changer in the CNFT community. We achieved a treasury valued at more than 1,200,000 ADA. Our NFT is in the top 20 sales of all time in the secondary market with over 1.7M ADA and we finished the first stage of our native Token airdrop known as $RAT. \n We are an organization of over 4,500 members. We are a part of the Cardano Community and our treasury of NFTs: include at the time of writing, the Berry Cardinal, 33 SpaceBudz, 52 DEADPXLs, 4 Clay Budz, 81 Clay Mates by Clay Nation, 16 Clay Nation x GC, 10 Yummi Universe Narus, 24 plots on Artifct Moon, 16 Eggvolution, an estate in Pavia, more than 100,000 ADA and an assortment of DeFi Tokens. A treasury composed of these assets is difficult to build as a single investor, unless you are a very early member of the Cardano NFT space. Being a member of RatsDAO offers the possibility of being exposed to these blue chip assets and this collection will only grow from here. We started as a new ambitious project on Cardano, meaning that all the tools that we need to develop are not currently at our disposal. This is why we are partnering with ADAO and working with developers to create new pionnering governance tools. We are promoting the growth of a new Cardano DAO ecosystem. \n Our most important goal is building Layer 0: The community. ",
        "title2": "Rationale",
        "desc2": "With the Ratpaper proposed by the team, we want to move from this foundational stage of RatsDAO and transition towards the largest DAO in the Cardano NFT ecosystem - both scalable and decentralized. From a strategic point of view, being the largest brings great advantages that would allow us to be protagonists in the evolution of this space. We believe that RatsDAO can achieve great things, in order to fully do so, we need to be a true representative of the Cardano ecosystem. The Ratpaper introduces a new concept, at the beginning we saw the value of the project in terms of scarcity of the NFTs. The incentive to buy Clay Nation or SpaceBud, for example, is that they are an original collection and there will never be more than 10,000. We replicated that concept in version 1.0 of the Whitepaper. But the truth is that for a DAO there is no need to limit the number of members. RatsDAO can be scalable and become a larger DAO by opening the doors to any new member who wants to join in the future with the ability to mint the NFT directly or buy from the secondary market. According to opencnft.io, at the time of drafting this document about 1.7 million ADA was traded on the Rats NFT secondary market; that 1.7 million ADA could have gone to the DAO’ s Treasury by allowing new members to participate in the minting of more NFTs. The true value of RatsDAO is reflected in the $RAT token, not the NFT. The more NFTs made available, the higher the treasury and the higher the value of $RAT. For example, Cardano does not limit it's wallet supply to investors, staking pools or members - it's unlimited. What is limited is the total supply of ADA at 45 Billion. As more members and wallet holders come to Cardano, the price increases as the additional demand creates scarcity. The same can be said for $Rat Token. As more members join RatsDAO it will become profitable for those who already received $RAT via airdrop. We have to keep in mind that the NFT was thought to be not only a financial asset, but also a Social Key Component of the DAO, similar to a membership. We can onboard as many people as possible without affecting the scarcity of the $RAT token. So we present the following whitepaper, the minting strategy for Rats DAO and the impact it may have in the profitability for Rats token holders.",
        "title3": "Why NFTs?",
        "desc3": "The material world is ruled by governments, the nation-states, and corporations. The digital world, the internet, is ruled by less than ten big corporations. People didn’t have power over social networks, emails or any digital assets, until decentralized blockchains gave people the possibility to become owners of their lives and digital properties. NFTs are maybe the most important of those digital properties. Bringing humanity the opportunity of becoming free of the corporations who control our digital lives. That’ s why we think NFTs will change the world having a faster adoption than blockchain’ s native tokens. The NFT market never stops, thanks to the increasing number of admirers of this new form of art and collecting. It was only a year ago, with the Mary hard fork, when native assets were allowed and Alessandro Berry created the Berry, a collection of 100 NFTs and the first NFT project on Cardano. In just one year of Cardano NFTs, hundreds of new projects were created. But this is just the beginning, we are preparing ourselves for a decade of NFTs, not only on Cardano, but also on other blockchains. The NFTs will change the world and will be a fundamental key to creating Web 3.0.",
        "title4": "Why Cardano?",
        "desc4": "RatsDAO supports decentralization and we believe that decentralized blockchains have a lot of potential. Bitcoin, Ethereum and Cardano are the most important blockchains and will keep growing and becoming more adopted by people around the world. With the rise in global economic destabilization, we see that banks and governments are confiscating citizen’ s money and the only way to have financial freedom is to use decentralized protocols to protect wealth. Cardano is a proof-of-stake, sustainable and open source blockchain, with a big focus on interoperability, security and scaling using a solid foundation of peer-reviewed data. Cardano is one of the few blockchains that has a solid community building on it. No matter the value of ADA, there is a true conviction that Cardano has a lot to offer to the people in the world suffering from economic problems. Cardano is our Nation.",
        "title5": "Porque una DAO?",
        "desc5": "Las Organizaciones Autónomas Descentralizadas son comunidades nativas digitales que se centran en una misión compartida. Los DAO coordinan capital y personas para aportar valor a toda la comunidad. Los DAO jugarán un papel clave en el desarrollo de blockchain y Web 3.0. Los DAO son una tendencia mundial en el presente, pero seguirán evolucionando en el futuro. Sin DAO, el ecosistema de Cardano no está completo, y somos muy optimistas sobre todas las posibilidades de DAO. Los DAO son supranacionales, porque están fuera de la jurisdicción de cualquier estado nacional. Si las NFT son el futuro de Internet, las DAO son el futuro del trabajo La creación de este tesoro inicial, la acuñación de 10 000 NFT de gobernanza y este crecimiento de Rats DAO es solo el comienzo. Nuestro objetivo es no solo ser una herramienta para aquellos que ya están en esta etapa inicial de Cardano y DAO, sino también incorporar a más personas a las NFT y al ecosistema de Cardano en general. En 2022 y los próximos años, cientos y miles de personas vendrán a Cardano.",
        "title6": "Rat Governance",
        "desc6": "In traditional organizations, decision making happens with a small group of executives. Contrary to this standard, the DAOs operate through a bottoms-up flow, where decisions are made through majority consensus. This does not mean that every single decision should involve the whole community, not any holder can be available 24/7 365 days a year to make a decision and vote and propose everything. Being a grassroots-driven community doesn't mean that there aren't leaderships or hierarchies inside the DAO. But these leaderships and hierarchies are specifics and are based on the knowledge everyone has. For example specifc members who know a specific NFT collection more will have more power deciding which specific NFT is better to purchase as they are more aware of rarities and values. Not every holder has to necessarily be involved with every vote, if you personally dont have any knowledge of a project you can choose to abstain from the vote. Decision-making happens within consensus, from Soft Consensus to Hard Consensus. Currently 100% of decision making is on Discord, and the goal is to have a smart contract governance system, fully on chain via a website. This doesn't mean that every single decision has to be voted on chain, and we can use discord voting on every day decision making. Discord voting, allows the DAO to make quick decisions and prevents us from becoming a stunted bureaucratic organization.",
        "title7": "$Rat Tokens: A 2 Layered DAO",
        "desc7": "Non-Fungible Token \nRatsDAO NFT is the Non Fungible Token which gives the owner access to RatsDAO. It functions as a membership card. Currently, there are 10,000 members governance tokens distributed in more than 4,500 wallets: 1,000 Genesis and 9,000 Governance. There will be no more Genesis or Governance tokens released. Each token currently represents one vote in the RatsDAO Discord, and grants access and property over the RatsDAO Treasury. Without the NFT you are not a RatsDAO member, you lose your rights over the DAO’ s assets, and your voting power. The Ratpaper introduces a new category: ‘Member’ NFT. This category would be scalable and unlimited, opening the door to any new members that want to join RatsDAO in the future with the possibility to mint the NFT directly or purchase in the secondary market. So the next minting stage will have two phases. The first one, that is going to be limited to 10.000 additional members, and the last one that is going to be a permanent door to be part of the DAO. For the first minting phase, there will be an additional airdrop of 10,000,000 $RAT tokens, an amount previously allocated to the “Grants for the community” . This airdrop will benefit both current and new members. \nIn the first airdrop, 5% of the total supply of $RAT was distributed amongst the 10,000 NFTs of Genesis and Governance members: each Governance received 277 $RAT and each Genesis received 2500 $RAT. With this new proposal, Genesis Token Holders will receive an additional 2000 $RAT alongside the 2.500 remaining airdrop, and Governance members will receive an additional 555 $RAT alongside the 277 remaining airdrop. New ‘Members’ will receive 300 $RAT per NFT in total. All NFTs will be eligible for staking, and will receive the same amount of $RAT by staking, but the value of the $RAT token would be more valuable as the value of treasury also increases.",
        "title8": "Fungible Token: $Rat Token:",
        "desc8": "$RAT is the reward that RatsDAO members receive via airdrop and by staking the NFT. This token has a fixed supply of 100,000,000 and there will never be more than this amount regardless of the number of members or NFTs that are minted. The voting power and the possibility of making proposals with the on-chain governance system will be based on $RAT once implemented and developed. The value of Rat should reflect more or less the value of the Rats Treasury. \nMinting income is distributed as follows: \n\n- 25% Devs & Team 75% DAO Treasury \n- 75% DAO Treasury \n\nRoyalties income is distributed as follows: \n\n- 30% Devs \n- 70% DAO Treasury",

The only difference is by how much we multiply the initial investment. Taking into account the price of $RATs for the first few weeks on the secondary markets, the community and the market seem to settle in the middle ground around the ideal case scenario. \nThe following numbers take into consideration the last airdrop, so Rats DAO NFT value only considers the remaining airdrops and staking rewards program. In the next two charts we show valuation in the current state of affairs, with 10k Rats DAO NFTs minted, and in a tentative 50k Rats DAO NFT minted scenario",

Rat Labs is a project fully independent from RatsDAO, in regards to it's funding and ownership. It's important to address this first, as we do not wish to create any confusion between the DAO and Rats Lab. However, the intention is the DAO will receive priority access to all Rats Lab projects, should the DAO wish to participate. Should it not wish to participate the mints will be made available to the public. Rats Lab will submit proposals on a project by project basis to the DAO to offer a percentage of the minting income generated from Rats Labs sales revenue and to provide an exclusive whitelist option to Rats NFT Holders. The amount of the income which Rats Lab set for the DAO to receive will always be at the discretion of Rats Lab. The aim of the Rats Lab is to provide new artists with a launchpad to offer their highest quality art directly to RatsDAO members. This will provide utility to the RatsDAO NFT and generate risk free additional revenue to the RatsDAO treasury. Rats Lab will be integrated into the main Rats Dao Discord under a section called Rats Lab, the intention here is that if the mint is made available as a public mint, it will generate new members and visitors to RatsDAO.",

The staking mechanism will operate very similar to how you currently list your NFT on a smart market place like JPG.Store. You will list your Rats DAO NFTs via smart contract which in return will earn you frequent amounts of $Rat Token. A nice way to think of your RatsDAO NFTs are like little Rat Miners, the more Rat NFTs you have the more $RAT you can effectively mine and release. So in simple terms the more Rat Members, the more tokens which are collectively released. Also, the more Rats which are staking, the fewer there are on secondary markets. Staking will commence once the final airdrops have been issued. \nStaking Rewards: \n450 $RAT Per Year",

You don't need anyone's permission to join Rats, and you don't need anyone's permission to contribute and start. DAOs don´ t have Team-User dynamic, Team and community are one in the same. And participation is fluid, you can jump-in and start contributing today to Rats development. We already see it in the discord on a day to day basis, rats members will go out of their way to welcome and help new people who have just joined the discord.

As DAOs are still WIP tools, the formal definition is not necessary to apply in reality in every case. Actually, most DAOs, even in Ethereum where they are most developed, don’t have most rules encoded in a smart contract. So some trust is still needed."}
